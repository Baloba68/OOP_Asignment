# OOP_Asignment
This is a simple Object Oriented Program asignment in python that follows the following instructions;
Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 
Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 
Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" , while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ).
